## üìù Usage

### Signup

Navigate to the `/signup` page to create a new account. Upon successful registration, the user is typically redirected to the `/login` page or the main dashboard.

### Login

Use the credentials from the signup process on the `/login` page. A successful login sets a secure session (e.g., a cookie) and redirects the user to the protected dashboard.

### Signout

A "Sign Out" button is available on the protected pages (e.g., `Header` or `Dashboard`). Clicking this button clears the session and redirects the user to the homepage or login page.
